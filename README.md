# Image-to-Text-to-Speech
This is a simple mini project which incorporates both the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and GTTS (Python libraries used for text-to-speech conversion). It asks for user's image file (.png,.jpg,.jpeg,...) which contains clear visible text and then gives back the audio file (in mp3 format) for the same.
